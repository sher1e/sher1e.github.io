        I received Ph.D. degree in cryptography from Fudan University. My research interests encompass post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and cryptographic engineering. I have published in journals and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC), IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS), IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC), IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (TIT), and the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). I also serve as reviewer for publications such as IEEE TIFS, Scientific Reports, and IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoTJ).
