abstract: |-
  A remarkable breakthrough in mathematics in recent years is the proof of the long-standing conjecture: sphere packing in the  $E_{8}$  lattice is optimal in the sense of the best density for sphere packing in  $\mathbb {R}^{8}$ . In this work, we design a mechanism for asymmetric key consensus from noise (AKCN), referred to as AKCN-E8, for error correction and key consensus. As a direct application, we present a practical key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) from the ideal lattice based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem. Compared with NewHope-KEM that was the second round candidate of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization, our AKCN-E8 KEM scheme overcomes some limitations and shortcomings of NewHope-KEM. Compared with some other dominating KEM schemes based on the variants of LWE, specifically Kyber and Saber, AKCN-E8 has a comparable performance but enjoys much flexible shared-key sizes. Specifically, the key encapsulated by AKCN-E8-512 (resp., 768, 1024) has the size of 256 (resp., 384, 512) bits. Flexible key size renders us stronger security against quantum attacks, more powerful and economic ability of key transportation, and better matches the demand in interactive protocols like TLS where parties need to negotiate the security parameters including the shared key length.
